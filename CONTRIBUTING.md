Contributing
============

In alignment with the open source nature of
[MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo) and its
[documentation](https://github.com/mongodb/docs) contributions to MongoDB
tutorials are happily welcomed.

The following guidelines should be followed for contribution if you want to
submit a tutorial.

Prerequisites
-------------

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)
* Familiarity with [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
  and [issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
* Knowledge of [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

How to Contribute
-----------------

**Before spending lots of time on a tutorial, ask for feedback on your idea
first!**

Please search [current tutorials](tutorials/), [issues](../../issues/), and
[pull requests](../../pulls/) before adding something new! This helps avoid
duplicating efforts.

Once you've confirmed that your tutorial doesn't already exist go ahead and
create a [new issue](../../issues/new) with the `new-tutorial` label. Inside
the issue's body you can outline what the goal of your tutorial is, and at a
high level how you plan to walk someone through accomplishing that goal.

After you've received feedback on your new tutorial 

Please review the following documents for our style, conventions, processes and
practices for the MongoDB Documentation:

* [Style Guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/meta/style-guide/)
* [Documentation Practices](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/meta/practices/)


* Fork the repository on GitHub
