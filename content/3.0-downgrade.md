# Downgrade MongoDB from 3.0

Before you attempt any downgrade, familiarize yourself with the content
of this document, particularly the [Downgrade Recommendations and Checklist](#downgrade-considerations)
and the procedure for [downgrading sharded clusters](#downgrade-cluster).


## Downgrade Recommendations and Checklist

When downgrading, consider the following:


### Downgrade Path

Once upgraded to MongoDB 3.0, you **cannot** downgrade to a version
lower than **2.6.8**.

Important: If you upgrade to MongoDB 3.0 and have run [``authSchemaUpgrade``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/authSchemaUpgrade/#dbcmd.authSchemaUpgrade), you **cannot** downgrade to the 2.6 series without disabling [``--auth``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#cmdoption-auth).


### Procedures

Follow the downgrade procedures:

* To downgrade sharded clusters, see [Downgrade a 3.0 Sharded Cluster](#downgrade-cluster).

* To downgrade replica sets, see [Downgrade a 3.0 Replica Set](#downgrade-replica-set).

* To downgrade a standalone MongoDB instance, see [Downgrade a Standalone mongod Instance](#downgrade-standalone).

Note: *Optional*. Consider [``compacting``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/compact/#dbcmd.compact) collections after downgrading. Otherwise, older versions will not be able to reuse free space regions larger than 2MB created while running 3.0. This can result in wasted space but no data loss following the downgrade.


## Downgrade MongoDB Processes


### Downgrade a Standalone ``mongod`` Instance

If you have changed the storage engine to ``WiredTiger``, change the
storage engine to MMAPv1 before downgrading to 2.6.


#### Change Storage Engine to MMAPv1

To change storage engine to MMAPv1 for a standalone [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod)
instance, you will need to manually export and upload the data using
[``mongodump``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongodump/#bin.mongodump) and [``mongorestore``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongorestore/#bin.mongorestore).


##### Step 1: Ensure 3.0 ``mongod`` is running with WiredTiger.


##### Step 2: Export the data using ``mongodump``.

```sh

mongodump --out <exportDataDestination>

```

Specify additional options as appropriate, such as username and
password if running with authorization enabled. See
[``mongodump``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongodump/#bin.mongodump) for available options.


##### Step 3: Create data directory for MMAPv1.

Create a new data directory for MMAPv1. Ensure that the user
account running [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) has read and write permissions for
the new directory.


##### Step 4: Restart the ``mongod`` with MMAPv1.

Restart the 3.0 [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod), specifying the newly created data
directory for MMAPv1 as the [``--dbpath``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#cmdoption-dbpath). You do not have to
specify [``--storageEngine``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#cmdoption-storageengine) as MMAPv1 is the default.

```sh

mongod --dbpath <newMMAPv1DBPath>

```

Specify additional options as appropriate.


##### Step 5: Upload the exported data using ``mongorestore``.

```sh

mongorestore <exportDataDestination>

```

Specify additional options as appropriate. See
[``mongorestore``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongorestore/#bin.mongorestore) for available options.


#### Downgrade Binaries

The following steps outline the procedure to downgrade a standalone
[``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) from version 3.0 to 2.6.

Once upgraded to MongoDB 3.0, you **cannot** downgrade to a version
lower than **2.6.8**.


##### Step 1: Download 2.6 binaries.

Download binaries of the latest release in the 2.6 series from the
[MongoDB Download Page](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads). See [Install MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation) for more
information.


##### Step 2: Replace with 2.6 binaries.

Shut down your [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) instance. Replace the existing
binary with the 2.6 [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) binary and restart
[``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod).


### Downgrade a 3.0 Replica Set

If you have changed the storage engine to WiredTiger, change the
storage engine to MMAPv1 before downgrading to 2.6.


#### Change Storage Engine to MMAPv1

You can update members to use the MMAPv1 storage engine in a rolling
manner.

Note: When running a replica set with mixed storage engines, performance can vary according to workload.

To change the storage engine to MMAPv1 for an existing secondary
replica set member, remove the member's data and perform an
[initial sync](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/resync-replica-set-member):


##### Step 1: Shutdown the secondary member.

Stop the [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) instance for the secondary member.


##### Step 2: Prepare data directory for MMAPv1.

Prepare [``--dbpath``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#cmdoption-dbpath) directory for initial sync.

For the stopped secondary member, either delete the content of the
data directory or create a new data directory. If creating a new
directory, ensure that the user account running [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) has
read and write permissions for the new directory.


##### Step 3: Restart the secondary member with MMAPv1.

Restart the 3.0 [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod), specifying the MMAPv1 data
directory as the [``--dbpath``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#cmdoption-dbpath). Specify additional options as
appropriate for the member. You do not have to specify
[``--storageEngine``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#cmdoption-storageengine) since MMAPv1 is the default.

```sh

mongod --dbpath <preparedMMAPv1DBPath>

```

Since no data exists in the ``--dbpath``, the [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) will
perform an initial sync. The length of the initial sync process
depends on the size of the database and network connection between
members of the replica set.

Repeat for the remaining the secondary members. Once all the secondary
members have switched to MMAPv1, step down the primary, and update the
stepped-down member.


#### Downgrade Binaries

Once upgraded to MongoDB 3.0, you **cannot** downgrade to a version
lower than **2.6.8**.

The following steps outline a "rolling" downgrade process for the
replica set. The "rolling" downgrade process minimizes downtime by
downgrading the members individually while the other members are
available:


##### Step 1: Downgrade secondary members of the replica set.

Downgrade each [*secondary*](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-secondary) member of the replica set, one at a
time:

1. Shut down the [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod). See [Stop mongod Processes](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/manage-mongodb-processes/#terminate-mongod-processes) for instructions on safely terminating [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) processes.

2. Replace the 3.0 binary with the 2.6 binary and restart.

3. Wait for the member to recover to ``SECONDARY`` state before downgrading the next secondary. To check the member's state, use the [``rs.status()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/rs.status/#rs.status) method in the [``mongo``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongo/#bin.mongo) shell.


##### Step 2: Step down the primary.

Use [``rs.stepDown()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/rs.stepDown/#rs.stepDown) in the [``mongo``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongo/#bin.mongo) shell to
step down the [*primary*](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-primary) and force the normal [failover](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/replica-set-high-availability/#replica-set-failover) procedure.

```javascript

rs.stepDown()

```

[``rs.stepDown()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/rs.stepDown/#rs.stepDown) expedites the failover procedure and is
   preferable to shutting down the primary directly.


##### Step 3: Replace and restart former primary ``mongod``.

When [``rs.status()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/rs.status/#rs.status) shows that the primary has stepped down
and another member has assumed ``PRIMARY`` state, shut down the
previous primary and replace the [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) binary with
the 2.6 binary and start the new instance.

Replica set failover is not instant but will render the set unavailable to
writes and interrupt reads until the failover process
completes. Typically this takes 10 seconds or more. You may wish to
plan the downgrade during a predetermined maintenance window.


### Downgrade a 3.0 Sharded Cluster


#### Requirements

While the downgrade is in progress, you cannot make changes to the
collection meta-data. For example, during the downgrade, do
**not** do any of the following:

* [``sh.enableSharding()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/sh.enableSharding/#sh.enableSharding)

* [``sh.shardCollection()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/sh.shardCollection/#sh.shardCollection)

* [``sh.addShard()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/sh.addShard/#sh.addShard)

* [``db.createCollection()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.createCollection/#db.createCollection)

* [``db.collection.drop()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.drop/#db.collection.drop)

* [``db.dropDatabase()``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.dropDatabase/#db.dropDatabase)

* any operation that creates a database

* any other operation that modifies the cluster meta-data in any way. See [Sharding Reference](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/sharding) for a complete list of sharding commands. Note, however, that not all commands on the [Sharding Reference](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/sharding) page modifies the cluster meta-data.


#### Change Storage Engine to MMAPv1

If you have changed the storage engine to WiredTiger, change the
storage engine to MMAPv1 before downgrading to 2.6.


##### Change Shards to Use MMAPv1

To change the storage engine to MMAPv1, refer to the procedure in
[Change Storage Engine to MMAPv1 for replica set members](#downgrade-repl-set-mmapv1) and [Change Storage Engine to
MMAPv1 for standalone mongod](#downgrade-mmapv1-standalone) as
appropriate for your shards.


##### Change Config Servers to Use MMAPv1

Note: During this process, only two config servers will be running at any given time to ensure that the sharded cluster's metadata is *read only*.


###### Step 1: Disable the Balancer.

Turn off the [balancer](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/sharding-balancer-administration/#sharding-balancing-internals) in the
sharded cluster, as described in
[Disable the Balancer](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/manage-sharded-cluster-balancer/#sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily).


###### Step 2: Stop the **last** config server listed in the [``mongos``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongos/#bin.mongos)' [``configDB``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#sharding.configDB) setting.


###### Step 3: Export data of the **second** config server listed in the [``mongos``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongos/#bin.mongos)' [``configDB``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#sharding.configDB) setting.

```sh

mongodump --out <exportDataDestination>

```

Specify additional options as appropriate, such as username and
password if running with authorization enabled. See
[``mongodump``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongodump/#bin.mongodump) for available options.


###### Step 4: For the **second** config server, create a new data directory for MMAPv1.

Ensure that the user account running [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod)
has read and write permissions for the new directory.


###### Step 5: Restart the **second** config server with MMAPv1.

Specify the newly created MMAPv1 data directory as the
[``--dbpath``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#cmdoption-dbpath) as well as any additional options as appropriate.

```sh

mongod --dbpath <newMMAPv1DBPath> --configsvr

```


###### Step 6: Upload the exported data using [``mongorestore``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongorestore/#bin.mongorestore) to the **second** config server.

```sh

mongorestore <exportDataDestination>

```

Specify additional options as appropriate. See
[``mongorestore``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongorestore/#bin.mongorestore) for available options.


###### Step 7: Shut down the **second** config server.


###### Step 8: Restart the **third** config server.


###### Step 9: Export data of the **third** config server.

```sh

mongodump --out <exportDataDestination>

```

Specify additional options as appropriate, such as username and
password if running with authorization enabled. See
[``mongodump``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongodump/#bin.mongodump) for available options.


###### Step 10: For the **third** config server, create a new data directory for MMAPv1.

Ensure that the user account running [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod)
has read and write permissions for the new directory.


###### Step 11: Restart the **third** config server with MMAPv1.

Specify the newly
created MMAPv1 data directory as the [``--dbpath``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#cmdoption-dbpath) as well
as any additional options as appropriate.

```sh

mongod --dbpath <newMMAPv1DBPath> --configsvr

```


###### Step 12: Upload the exported data using [``mongorestore``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongorestore/#bin.mongorestore) to the **third** config server.

```sh

mongorestore <exportDataDestination>

```

Specify additional options as appropriate. See
[``mongorestore``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongorestore/#bin.mongorestore) for available options


###### Step 13: Export data of the **first** config server listed in the [``mongos``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongos/#bin.mongos)' [``configDB``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#sharding.configDB) setting.

```sh

mongodump --out <exportDataDestination>

```

Specify additional options as appropriate, such as username and
password if running with authorization enabled. See
[``mongodump``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongodump/#bin.mongodump) for available options.


###### Step 14: For the **first** config server, create data directory for MMAPv1.

Ensure that the user account running [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod)
has read and write permissions for the new directory.


###### Step 15: Restart the **first** config server with MMAPv1.

Specify the newly
created MMAPv1 data directory as the [``--dbpath``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#cmdoption-dbpath) as well
as any additional options as appropriate.

```sh

mongod --dbpath <newMMAPv1DBPath> --configsvr

```


###### Step 16: Upload the exported data using [``mongorestore``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongorestore/#bin.mongorestore) to the **first** config server.

```sh

mongorestore <exportDataDestination>

```

Specify additional options as appropriate. See
[``mongorestore``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongorestore/#bin.mongorestore) for available options


###### Step 17: Enable writes to the sharded cluster's metadata.

Restart the **second** config server, specifying the newly created
MMAPv1 data directory as the [``--dbpath``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#cmdoption-dbpath). Specify
additional options as appropriate.

```sh

mongod --dbpath <newMMAPv1DBPath> --configsvr

```

Once all three config servers are up, the sharded cluster's metadata
is available for writes.


###### Step 18: Re-enable the balancer.

Once all three config servers are up and running with WiredTiger,
[Re-enable the balancer](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/manage-sharded-cluster-balancer/#sharding-balancing-enable).


#### Downgrade Binaries

Once upgraded to MongoDB 3.0, you **cannot** downgrade to a version
lower than **2.6.8**.

The downgrade procedure for a sharded cluster reverses the order of the
upgrade procedure. The version ``v6`` config database is backwards
compatible with MongoDB 2.6.


##### Step 1: Disable the Balancer.

Turn off the [balancer](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/sharding-balancer-administration/#sharding-balancing-internals) in the
sharded cluster, as described in
[Disable the Balancer](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/manage-sharded-cluster-balancer/#sharding-balancing-disable-temporarily).


##### Step 2: Downgrade each shard, one at a time.

For each shard:

1. Downgrade the [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) secondaries *before* downgrading the primary.

2. To downgrade the primary, run [``replSetStepDown``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/replSetStepDown/#dbcmd.replSetStepDown) and downgrade.


##### Step 3: Downgrade the config servers.

Downgrade all 3 [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) config server instances, leaving
the *first* system in the ``mongos --configdb`` argument to
downgrade *last*.


##### Step 4: Downgrade the [``mongos``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongos/#bin.mongos) instances.

Downgrade and restart each [``mongos``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongos/#bin.mongos), one at a time. The
downgrade process is a binary drop-in replacement.


##### Step 5: Re-enable the balancer.

Once the upgrade of sharded cluster components is
complete, [re-enable the balancer](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/manage-sharded-cluster-balancer/#sharding-balancing-enable).


## General Downgrade Procedure

**Except** as described on this page, moving between 2.6 and 3.0 is a
drop-in replacement:


### Step 1: Stop the existing ``mongod`` instance.

For example, on Linux, run 3.0 [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) with the
[``--shutdown``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#cmdoption-shutdown) option as follows:

```sh

mongod --dbpath /var/mongod/data --shutdown

```

Replace ``/var/mongod/data`` with your MongoDB [``dbPath``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#storage.dbPath).
See also the [Stop mongod Processes](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/manage-mongodb-processes/#terminate-mongod-processes) for alternate methods of
stopping a [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) instance.


### Step 2: Start the new ``mongod`` instance.

Ensure you start the 2.6 [``mongod``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/#bin.mongod) with the same
[``dbPath``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#storage.dbPath):

```sh

mongod --dbpath /var/mongod/data

```

Replace ``/var/mongod/data`` with your MongoDB [``dbPath``](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/configuration-options/#storage.dbPath).
